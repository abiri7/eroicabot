# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Eroica Bot

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A discord bot that allows users to command the bot to pull up guides for Eroica game and such.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

Our software will display guides when prompted, for example -> doing .airi (airi being a character in the Eroica game) would make the bot pull up the character sheet showing airi's stats. In addition, there will be other commands that pull up info that other users make. Lastly, there will be the .ping command to check if the bot is online. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

I am colloborating with Phuoc Nguyen.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

Making a discord bot that runs.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Making a discord bot that is capable of pulling up images and other files that users request for.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

In addition to the above, perhaps make it run 24/7 so I don't have to keep the bot running on my pc at all times.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

We will need to first find out how to make a discord bot which is enlisted in the discord.py documentation. Then there is the issue of finding out how to write all the commands so the bot is able to handle the requested information. And lastly, how to get the bot running 24/7.

Abir Islam -> Finding out how to make a discord bot, and making basic commands
Phuoc Nguyen -> searching for methods to make the bot 24/7, and work with git if need be.
