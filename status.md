Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

We have built the bot, hosted it 24/7, and it is available for public use.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

Still have yet to integrate character commands for each of the Eroica characters that will pull up an infographic regarding each of their abilities.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

All encountered problems have been resolved.
However problems that we did encounter were hosting the bot for over 500 hours (heroku caps at 500, but we realized we could get 1000 for free).
Another problem was dealing with cogs, but in the end we just opted to write the code all in one script w/o the hassle of loading/unloading cogs.
